What is a container ?

Build container with three concepts :
            1- Linux Namespaces.
            {
                - What you can see.
                - Created with syscalls
            }
            2- Changing the root.
            3- Control Groups
            {
                - What you can use.
                - Filesystem inteface.
            }

signification: docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
            -d : run the container in detached mode (in the background)
            -p : map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container
            docker/getting-started : the image to use
