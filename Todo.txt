            {
                - what you can see.
                - Created with syscalls
            }
            2- changing the root.

            {
                - what you can use.
                - Filesystem inteface.

signification: docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
            -d : run the container in detached mode (in the background)
            -p : map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container=
            docker/getting-started : the image to use
